					<h2>User Interviews</h2>
					<p>With user interviews, you get a clear idea of what the people you're interviewing wants out of the website you're trying to create. This is extremely important if the person you're interviewing is a recruiter or hiring manager. It's really helpful in the ways of what kind of content you should have, how your interactive design should behave and the kind of style or look that would be most appealing. The questions were centered around what their occupation was, goals, and what they would love to see from a portfolio website.</p>

					<h2>Competitor Analysis</h2>
					<p>A competitor analysis is identifying your competitors and evaluating their strategies to determine their strengths and weaknesses relative to those of your own product or service. The website I was making had to focus on showcasing my skills and projects as a mobile app developer. For that reason I reviewed other mobile app developers' websites. I reviewed and analyzed both large corporations and freelance developers. The difference is one works in a team and for a corporation while freelance developers are hired and work for themselves. I wanted to analyze both in order to understand what I should have on my website and how to show it the best way possible.</p>

					<h2>Feature Value Matrix</h2>
					<p>The use of the feature value matrix was to map the value of my recommended features and service across needs and defines the criteria by which I would judge each recommendation successful. The features I had listed on there was the contact by email so whoever is interested in you has a way of contacting you. I had links to projects so people could see what I worked on, a navigation bar so users can easily navigate through my website and distinguishable sections for better readability and my users aren't overwhelemed with information. Other features I listed on there were just to make the website feel more alive and animated as well as adding symbols and icons for looks.</p>

					<h2>Feature Prioritization</h2>
					<p>I prioritized the features based on the value they had and how difficult it would be to implement such features. Using the previously before mentioned feature value matrix, gave me the values and helped me prioritize them. It's very useful to use to help you try to work on what the core of the interface and determine what features are necessary and what are not. It helps pace the work and set deadlines for yourself to turn in a decent interface/product.</p>

					<h2>User Stories</h2>
					<p>User stories help place you in the shoes of the person viewing your website along with knowing what they're looking for and why they're looking for it. I of course wanted to create a story about certain elements of my website that recruiters or hiring managers would look for. Not only them but also daily users of the internet to see if my website was appealing and easy to read or navigate through.</p>

					<h2>Cognitive Walkthrough</h2>
					<p>A cognitive walkthrough is a usability evaluation method in which one or more evaluators work through a series of tasks and ask a set of questions from the perspective of the user. It was kind of difficult deciding who should take my cognitive walkthrough test. I don't have any connections to any recruiters or hiring managers so I did my best in trying to at least pick people that were the same major as me and who were working for programming companies. I also could've asked more relevant questions towards my website but at the moment I felt that I was satisfied with them.</p>

					<h2>User Test</h2>
					<p>I conducted two kinds of user tests. One was a click test to see if users could navigate their way through the website to be able to send me an email. It was to test out my contact by email feature and whether or not it worked. The only challenge I faced was that I wasn't recieving good feedback for why they clicked where they clicked. Some weren't even answering the follow up question at all. The other test was just a question test where I asked a couple questions about my website pertaining to how it looked and what they thought the purpose of the website was. The challenge with this is that people didn't really want to spend to much time on it so I couldn't really ask any in-depth questions without wasting too much of their time. But I did recieve really good feedback on it so overall the test went well.</p>
