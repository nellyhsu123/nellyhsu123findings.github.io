					<h2>User Interviews</h2>
					<p>With user interviews, you get a clear idea of what the people you're interviewing wants out of the website you're trying to create. This is extremely important if the person you're interviewing is a recruiter or hiring manager. It's really helpful in the ways of what kind of content you should have, how your interactive design should behave and the kind of style or look that would be most appealing. The questions were centered around what their occupation was, goals, and what they would love to see from a portfolio website.</p>

					<h2>Competitor Analysis</h2>
					<p>A competitor analysis is identifying your competitors and evaluating their strategies to determine their strengths and weaknesses relative to those of your own product or service. The website I was making had to focus on showcasing my skills and projects as a mobile app developer. For that reason I reviewed other mobile app developers' websites. I reviewed and analyzed both large corporations and freelance developers. The difference is one works in a team and for a corporation while freelance developers are hired and work for themselves. I wanted to analyze both in order to understand what I should have on my website and how to show it the best way possible.</p>
