					<h2>User Interviews</h2>
					<p>With user interviews, you get a clear idea of what the people you're interviewing wants out of the website you're trying to create. This is extremely important if the person you're interviewing is a recruiter or hiring manager. It's really helpful in the ways of what kind of content you should have, how your interactive design should behave and the kind of style or look that would be most appealing. The questions were centered around what their occupation was, goals, and what they would love to see from a portfolio website.</p>
